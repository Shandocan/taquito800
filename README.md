FIRST CHALLENGE

Hello and Welcome 

In this very first project i have done i try to add as many notes as i can on 
the line of coding, to remenbere myself and to show others what i done, 
and how i do it, however i also look into so other sources of information to 
try to enproube my coding.
There for I would like to thanks Simon Monk, Michael Dawson and so many others 
from who i found the motivation to do all this.
