FIRST CHALLENGE

Hello and Welcome 

In this first challenge I deploy a page with a number of links and logs, no much, but a start.
some of them are no in line as good as the should be, it needs more polishing work and I'm sorry 
for that, but it will be much better next time.

Thank you Neil and Haley for being so patient with me.
